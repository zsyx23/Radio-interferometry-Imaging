**Experiments:** to reproduce simulations results reported in the article, run the code "main_simulated_data.m". Real data tests can be run with the code "main_real_data.m" where the measurement set columns need to be loaded from a .mat file.

**Dependencies:** the present codes includes the MATLAB NUFFT algorithm available at http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/irt/fessler.tgz, described in
